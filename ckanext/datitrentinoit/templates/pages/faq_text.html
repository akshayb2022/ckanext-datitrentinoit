<h3 id="1">1 - What is the Trentino Open Data Portal?? <a href="#1">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The Trentino Open Data Portal is a data catalogue that allows you to search, access, download and preview of the open data collected in the Trentino province through a single access point.</p>
<p>Thanks to compliance with the standards defined in the open data guidelines approved by the Provincial resolution n. 2858/2012, open data and open documents collected on the catalogue are ready to be reused both from a technological point of view that from legal point of view.</p>
<p>The open data guidelines provide details about the legal aspects of the release to public of the data, a set of open formats to be used, instructions on how to do enrich the data with a defined set of metadata and a minimum related documentation in order to facilitate the reuse.</p>
<p>The data loading and update is a continuous and constant process that is and will be developed in collaboration with all the territory stakeholder, both public and private .

<h3 id="2">2 - What is Open Data <a href="#2">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Data refers to the individual pieces of information from various sources, describing facts unambiguously reproducible and can be expressed and stored in digital formats. </ P>
<p> The CAD (art. 68, c. 3, letter. b) describe open data as data that have the following characteristics:

   <li> are accessible through information and communication technologies, including public and private computer networks, in open formats in compliance with  subparagraph a), that are suitable for use by automated computer programs and are provided with the metadata; </ li>
   <li> are made available free of charge through the technologies of information and communication, including public and private computer networks, or be made available to the marginal costs incurred for their reproduction and dissemination. </ li>
</ul></p>

Improves the level of sharing, increases the quality of data and provides considerable support in the search for data. The goal is to promote the reuse of data by encouraging the development of innovative ideas.</p>

<h3 id="10">10 - Which are the PaT ongoing actions on opendata? <a href="#10">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The open data policy of the Autonomous Province of Trento for are described here (italian):
<a href="http://www.innovazione.provincia.tn.it/documentazione/in_trentino/pagina182.html">http://www.innovazione.provincia.tn.it/documentazione/in_trentino/pagina182.html</a>
Il Open data in Trentino is described here (italian):
<a href="http://www.innovazione.provincia.tn.it/opendata">http://www.innovazione.provincia.tn.it/opendata</a></p>
<p> Since 2010, the PaT has initiated a series of actions for the promotion of open government data, widely described in the documents of strategic planning for innovation enabled by ICT. Following the publication of geographic data of PaT in open format (PaT resolution n. 195/2012), was approved the Provincial Law (L.P.) n. 16/2012 (art. 9), according to which the PaT ensures the availability, management, access, transmission, storage and usability in digital mode of public data and documents containing public data that it owns. Moreover, in order to create conditions for fair reuse, proportionate and non-discriminatory, PaT will adopt ICT Internet technologies and it will publish the data in open formats, releasing them with standard licenses such as Creative Commons licenses. <br />
To implement the L.P. n. 16, in year 2012, PaT started the process of publishing open data of Trentino through the preparation of the open data policy and guidelines and the identification of a first set of data to be released as open data. In 2013, PaT started the project "Open Data in Trentino" Special coordinated from office regarding Innovation, in partnership with Informatica Trentina, TrentoRise, Fondazione Bruno Kessler and University of Trento. The publication of the "Open data of Trentino" data portal dati.trentino.it, and the continuous update of it, is the main activity around which develops the whole project. </p>

<h3 id="11">11 - What is an open format? <a href="#11">&para;</a></h3>
<p> The Digital Administration Code (CAD) provides this definition of open data format: a data format made public, documented exhaustively and neutral than the technological tools necessary for the use of the data (art. 68, c. 3, lett. a));
For example, to represent a table, the CSV format (vd <a href="#14">"How to open a data file in .csv format?"</a>) fulfills this requirement in that:
<ul>
 <li> it is a data format (eg. not an image); </ li>
 <li> it is simple and well documented; </ li>
 <li> it is neutral with respect to the technological tools necessary for its use as it can be opened with different software on different platforms. </ li>
</ul></p>

<h3 id="13">13 - What is a metadata? <a href="#13">&para;</a></h3>
<p>
The term metadata we refers to the information that describes a set of data. In the specific case of the descriptive metadata, they constitute a level of information contained in the data and make explicit some features of it and make it more easy to identify. To facilitate the availability of data and their interoperability is important to use descriptive elements such as title, description, link, display the license validity period, owner, size, etc. For more details and for the implementation of the metadata inside the open data catalogue please consult the <a href="http://www.innovazione.provincia.tn.it/binary/pat_innovazione/notizie/AllegatoB_formati_21Dicembre_def.1356705197.pdf" target="_blank"> "allegato B" of the Open Data policy adopted by PaT</a>.</p>

<h3 id="14">14 - How to open a data file in .csv format? <a href="#14">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The .csv (Comma Separated Value) is a text format that is used to distribute data in a tabular format. Each line of the file corresponds to a row of the data table and the contents of the cells are identified by the chosen separator (comma or semicolon or any other symbol).<br />
The .csv file can be read using either open source software such as OpenOffice Calc, as well as using a proprietary software such as Microsoft Excel.</p>

<h3 id="15">15 - How to open data file in .shp format? <a href="#15">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The format .shp ("ESRI Shapefile") is a data format for geographical data. It is composed by a set of several files with the same name and different extension (eg. Ammcmp.shp, ammcmp.shx, ammcmp.dbf and ammcmp.prj), for this reason they are distributed in a single .zip file (a format that in addition compress it, allowing to distribute files in a single file). To use them, you must first of all, unzip the zip file, and then open it with a GIS (Geographical Information Systems) software, such as Quantum GIS, OpenJump, gvSIG, ESRI ArcGIS etc.</p>

<h3 id="16">16 - How to open data file in .json format? <a href="#16">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The format .json (JavaScript Object Notation) is a suitable format for the exchange of data in client-server web application. It is used in programming  as an alternative to XML/XSLT. The simplicity of the JSON format has determined its adoption and its use via JavaScript is particularly simple, because the interpreter is able to perform the parsing through a simple call to one function (the function "eval ()").
It is not a format targeting a direct use in desktop applications, it is therefore not easily usable instead of other data formats. it can be viewed with a "json viewer" inside the browser and also converted to other formats with free tools such as <a href="http://konklone.io/json/"> Konklone </a> </p>

<h3 id="17">17 - What is an API?<a href="#17">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The acronym API (Application Programming Interface) indicates the way in which computer programs communicate with each other. Can be understood as a communication protocol to which programmers refer to write software programs to query other programs. The open data catalogue can be queried via the CKAN API, published with open specifications by OKFN.</p>

<h3 id="18">18 - What is an open data license? <a href="#18">&para;</a></h3>
<p> In most national laws, there are intellectual property rights that can prevent third parties to use, reuse and redistribute data without explicit permission. When satisfied the absence of intellectual property constraints that prevent the opening of public data, it is necessary to apply to them a license that defines the conditions and procedures for re-use by anyone for commercial purposes(in compliance with  art. 8 del D. Lgs. 36/2006, art. 9 della L. P. 16/2012 e all'art. 68 CAD). PaT makes use of the licenses Creative Commons Zero (CC0) and Creative Commons Attribuzione (CC-BY). </p>
